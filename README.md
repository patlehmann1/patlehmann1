### Hey! How's it going?

- I'm a back-end node.js developer, I write JavaScript and TypeScript. I do have *some* front-end experience in React.
- I love contributing to open source and I can be found on here, looking for new issues. If you have a project you'd like for me to contribute to, feel free to reach out!
- I love golfing, listening to music, spending time in nature and trying new food.
- I'm a coding bootcamp graduate and I love talking to new programmers. Feel free to reach out!
